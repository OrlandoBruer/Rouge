TO DO LIST: 

Continue working on the Game class to make the EnemyManager class usable 
(i.e. set up some sort of turn mechanism)

Work on RoomMap generation from text files (this will make testing a lot easier)

Set up some sort of default pathing for enemies, or add some sort of random wandering mechanic
(or both)

Draw sprites for:
- the player
- enemies 
- doors
- spaces when hovered over and clicked
- spaces when within movement range of the player
- spaces when near the edge
- 

Set up HUD for health, movement, etc.

Set up combat (!!!). create a "Combat" or "CombatManager" class to handle fights 

Set up a FloorMap class which stores the number of RoomMaps on a floor in a grid format probably
similar to the one used in RoomMap
