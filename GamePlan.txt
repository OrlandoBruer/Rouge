Rouge Game Ideas

A grid-based traditional roguelike where each movement advances the turn (allowing enemies to move). Similar to Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Each floor is a grid of clickable buttons which are used to control player movement. 

On the ground, items spawn which can increase a number of stats for the player. Enemies also roam around the corridors , randomly when the player is not nearby, and toward the player when within a certain range. When combat occurs, both combatants stats are compared, and damage is dealt simultaneously.

Proposed stats:
- Strength/Weapon Damage: the raw strength of your attacks. 
- Agility/Speed: how many tiles you can move before the enemy gets a chance to.
- Vitality/Armour: your max health or armour

Proposed item slots:
- Weapon (Str)
- Armour (Vit)
- Boots (Agi)

Items may also have abilities attached to them. 

The goal of each floor is to find the key that unlocks the stairs to the next floor, and then take those stairs up.
